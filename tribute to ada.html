        <h3>"Ada Lovelace"</h2>
        <h4>Many consider Ada Lovelace to be the world's first computer programmer.</h3>
        <p>
          Born in England on December 10, 1815, Ada was the daughter of the famous poet Lord George Byron and his wife, Lady Anne Byron. Her father left the family just weeks after Ada’s birth, but her mother insisted that her daughter have expert tutors to teach her math and science.
        </p>
        <p>
          Impressively, as a child, Ada showed exceptional gift of imagination and penned a book, Flyology, describing how to fly.
        </p>
        <p>
          When she was 17, Ada met mathematician and inventor Charles Babbage at a town party. She was fascinated by his Difference Engine, an early version of the calculator.
        </p>
        <p>
          Her exceptional gifts for maths led her to develop a close working relationship with Babbage, who is known as “the father of computers”.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 1843, Babbage was developing the Analytical Engine, a more complicated version of the Difference Engine. He asked Lovelace to translate French text from his engineer into English. Lovelace not only translated the notes but added her own, signing them “A.A.L.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Since the analytical engine was never built, her first “computer program” was never tested properly. However, her work was seen as the first computer algorithm.
        </p>
        <p>
          in 1953, her notes were republished in a book about digital computing that showed how computers work by following patterns. It turns out that long before the first computer was invented, Lovelace had come up with the idea for a computer language.
        </p>
        <p>
          Lovelace died on November 10, 1852, more than a hundred years before her notes were rediscovered. But because of her advanced way of thinking, she’s often considered the first computer programmer. In fact, in 1979, the U.S. Department of Defense named a new computer language “Ada” in her honor.
